Taiwan is an island located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 100 miles off the coast of southeastern China. It's approximately 245 miles long and 90 miles wide and is home to about 24 million people who speak languages like Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, and indigenous languages.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false' messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-0438da1d944f00b16fd2\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-0438da1d944f00b16fd2\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"setView\":[[23.6978,120.9605],7,[]],\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[25.0328,121.5654,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},\"Taipei\",null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[25.0328,25.0328],\"lng\":[121.5654,121.5654]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Why Taiwan?\n\nI've chosen to analyze Taiwan's carbon emissions because it is a country that has enormous potential to decarbonize. Taiwan's biggest power station is also the world's #1 top emitter of GHG emissions. According to [Statista,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1393557/most-polluting-power-plants-worldwide/#:~:text=The%20Taichung%20Power%20Plant%20in,power%20station%20in%20the%20world.) \"**The Taichung Power Plant in Taiwan was the most polluting power station worldwide in 2022**, having released an estimated 32.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCOâ‚‚e). With an installed capacity of 5,500 megawatts, the coal-fired **Taichung Power Plant is the fourth largest power station in the world**.\" Just decarbonizing this one power plant alone can result in a dramatic reduction in Taiwan's overall emissions.\n\nTransitioning to renewable energy is crucial for Taiwan. By moving towards renewable energy sources, Taiwan can enhance its energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. Embracing renewables also helps in combating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global sustainability efforts. Economically, investing in clean energy offers growth opportunities and innovation potential, with Taiwan's private sector already [showing commitment](https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/08/on-the-path-to-net-zero-will-taiwan-reach-its-goal/) to a cleaner energy future. This shift not only positions Taiwan as a regional leader in sustainable energy but also contributes to an environmentally resilient future for the island. We will be getting a better of idea of where Taiwan currently stands in its emissions generation through visualizing data from [ClimateTrace](https://climatetrace.org/) and [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions).\n\n# The infographic\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../Documents/2_Areas/Areas_MEDS/Winter_Quarter/Data_Viz_240/HWs/hamilton-eds240-HW4/final_work/final_png.png){width=1270}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Data, Approach, Limitations\n\n## The Data\n\n-   **Sector specific emissions:** This year [ClimateTrace](https://climatetrace.org/) introduced an open emissions database with over 352 million assets, covering human-caused emissions from various facilities globally. It spans every country, major economic sector, and nearly all greenhouse gas emission sources. This detailed dataset, accessible for free, is one of the most comprehensive and granular view of recent GHG emissions available for the public. Utilizing satellites, remote sensing, AI, and machine learning, it offers transparency for assessing each country's emission reduction progress. This project subsets the dataset for Taiwan's emissions from 2016-2022.\n\n    Access the dataset [here](https://climatetrace.org/inventory%20year_from=2022&year_to=2022&gas=co2e100).\n\n-   **Historical CO2 per capita emissions & CO2 contributions by fuel type:**\n\n    OurWorldInData compiles data on many countries' emissions data from work from many different people and organizations. We will be using their datasets historical CO2 per capita emissions & CO2 contributions by fuel type in 2020, subsetting for just Taiwan's data.\n\n    Access the datasets [here](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions).\n\n## The Approach\n\n\\\nI chose to communicate the data through an infographic, incorporating a line plot, pie chart, and stacked area chart arranged to evoke an industrial ambiance. The line chart mimics the emission of smoke from a stack, the pie chart suggests a moon, and the stacked area chart resembles a container on a ship. The overall dark, nocturnal theme not only adds a sense of foreboding but also implies a lack of transparency, creating an ominous atmosphere for the observer. A keen-eyed viewer might notice an additional smoke plume subtly resembling the shape of Taiwan.\n\nFor enhanced visibility, I opted for high-contrast colors of dark grey and white, and bolded the text in Josefin and Times New Roman for the title. Alt text was included to improve web usability. To prevent information overload, I balanced the data-ink ratio, removing grid lines and simplifying the message, especially in the stacked area plot, where font size indicates relative proportions.\n\nThe predominantly monochrome palette ensures color-blind friendliness, and I used online colorblind simulators to confirm the graphic's accessibility. To address the topic on level of individual agency, I incorporated a graphic detailing Taiwan's per capita emissions. Additionally, I provided a concise blurb to contextualize the significance of the topic, ensuring that viewers grasp its importance.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis visualization falls short of directly engaging with the critical aspects surrounding the feasibility of decarbonization in Taiwan. It does not delve into the economic, socioeconomic, and environmental repercussions associated with such a transition. Furthermore, it does not offer actionable suggestions. Instead, the visualization primarily serves as an overview of Taiwan's current carbon emissions landscape.\n\n# Let's visualize!\n\n## Setting up Libraries, loading font types\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# --------------------------------------------\n#  Setup libraries \n# --------------------------------------------\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(treemapify)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(extrafont)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(glue)\n\n#..........................import fonts..........................\nfont_add_google(name = \"Josefin Sans\", family = \"josefin\")\nfont_add_google(name = \"Sen\", family = \"sen\")\n\n#................enable {showtext} for rendering.................\nshowtext_auto()\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Plot 1: Stacked Area Plot of GHG emissions by sector type, in Taiwan (2016-2022)\n\n## Data Cleaning\n\nClimateTrace's dataset is large, and we can aggregate sectors into subsectors, based on ClimateTrace's grouping conventions.\n\n## \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# --------------------------------------------\n# Loading/Cleaning Climate Trace emissions data\n# --------------------------------------------\nemissions <- read.csv(\"~/Documents/2_Areas/Areas_MEDS/Winter_Quarter/Data_Viz_240/HWs/hamilton-eds240-HW4/data/trace_data_since_2015_to_2022_countries_TWN.csv\")\n\n\n# Data cleaning & rename each subsector\nemissions_df <- emissions %>% \n  select(sector, year, co2e_100yr) %>% \n  mutate(subsector = case_when(\n    sector %in% c(\"solid-waste-disposal\", \n                  \"biological-treatment-of-solid-waste-and-biogenic\", \n                  \"wastewater-treatment-and-discharge\",\n                  \"incineration-and-open-burning-of-waste\") ~ 'waste',\n    \n    sector %in% c(\"manure-left-on-pasture-cattle\", \n                  \"forest-land-fires\", \n                  \"rice-cultivation\", \n                  \"enteric-fermentation-cattle-pasture\", \n                  \"manure-management-cattle-feedlot\", \n                  \"enteric-fermentation-cattle-feedlot\", \n                  \"other-agricultural-soil-emissions\", \n                  \"enteric-fermentation-other\",  \n                  \"cropland-fires\", \n                  \"shrubgrass-fires\", \n                  \"manure-management-other\") ~ \"agriculture\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"other-onsite-fuel-usage\", \"residential-and-commercial-onsite-fuel-usage\") ~ \"buildings\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"fluorinated-gases\") ~ \"fluorinated gases\",\n    \n    sector %in% c(\"oil-and-gas-production-and-transport\",\n                  \"oil-and-gas-refining\", \n                  \"other-fossil-fuel-operations\") ~ \"fossil fuel operations\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"water-reservoirs\", \n                  \"net-forest-land\", \n                  \"forest-land-clearing\", \n                  \"forest-land-degradation\",\n                  \"net-wetland\", \n                  \"net-shrubgrass\", \n                  \"wetland-fires\") ~ \"forestry and land use\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"aluminum\",\n                  \"other-manufacturing\",  \n                  \"chemicals\",\n                  \"cement\", \n                  \"pulp-and-paper\",\n                  \"petrochemicals\",\n                  \"steel\") ~ \"manufacturing\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"copper-mining\",\n                  \"iron-mining\", \n                  \"sand-quarrying\", \n                  \"rock-quarrying\") ~ \"mineral extraction\", \n    \t\n\n    sector %in% c(\"electricity-generation\",  \n                  \"other-energy-use\") ~ \"power\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"international-shipping\",  \n                  \"domestic-aviation\", \n                  \"domestic-shipping\", \n                  \"international-aviation\",\n                  \"other-transport\", \n                  \"railways\", \n                  \"road-transportation\") ~ \"transportation\", \n    \n    sector %in% c(\"removals\") ~ \"removals\"\n  ))\n\n# Filter out rows based on multiple values\nvalues_to_exclude <- c( \"biological-treatment-of-solid-waste-and-biogenic\", \"other-transport\", \"removals\")\nemissions_df <- emissions_df %>% drop_na() %>% filter(!(sector %in% values_to_exclude))\n\n\n### Now, aggregate emissions for each subsector \nemissions_df_subsector <- emissions_df %>% group_by(subsector, year) %>% mutate(co2e_100yr_subsector = sum(co2e_100yr)) %>% select(-c(\"co2e_100yr\", \"sector\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe next step is to ignore negative emissions, or CO2e sinks, so that we can analyze just total emissions output (as opposed to net emissions).

Taiwan is highlighted with a gold color, while the United States and China are in white. The income group averages are grey. This dataset spans from the onset of the industrial revolution (early 1800's), and it shows a surge in Taiwan's emissions post-1960, coinciding with Taiwan's robust economic expansion during that period.\n\nIn the 1960s, Taiwan experienced the \"Taiwan Miracle,\" marked by rapid economic growth and industrialization. Key factors included land reforms, export-oriented policies, foreign investments, and educational advancements. This period shifted Taiwan's economy from that based on agriculture to export-focused industries, resulting in significant economic expansion and a surge in per capita emissions post-1960.\n\nNotably, we see that Taiwan's emissions are now higher than that of most high-income countries, including China, and are converging close to that of the United States!\n\n# Assembling an Infographic\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ðŸ”¡ text ---------------------------------------------------\nquotes <- c(\"Taiwan's current carbon emissions standing is significant, with the country being among the top 25 largest carbon emitters globally. In recent years, Taiwan has been taking steps towards reducing its carbon footprint and transitioning to cleaner energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The country has set ambitious goals, such as investing in renewable energy technologies and implementing a carbon fee system for large emitters to incentivize emission reduction.
