The blackout was not solely due to one type of energy source, as every electricity source---natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind, and solar---fell short during the extreme weather conditions. Many components of energy plants froze with the vast majority of these plants being powered by natural gas, leading to widespread outage. The blackout highlighted the vulnerability of the U.S. electric grid to extreme weather events and the need for prioritizing energy infrastructure to prevent similar crises in the future \\[[1](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-blackout-preventable/)\\]\\[[2](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/02/why-the-power-is-out-in-texas-and-why-other-states-are-vulnerable-too/)\\]\\[[3](https://www.vox.com/22308149/texas-blackout-power-outage-winter-uri-grid-ercot)\\].\n\nThe blackout also disproportionately affected communities of color, with approximately 70% of Texans losing electrical power at some point between February 14th and 20th. The recovery from the loss of health and property damage became less likely for those most severely affected, making them more vulnerable to future crises. This highlighted the need for the prioritization of these communities through direct investment and focused attention from local and state governments in coordination with utility providers \\[[4](https://ncdp.columbia.edu/ncdp-perspectives/disaster-response-and-equity-texas-power-outrages/¬†)\\].\n\n### Project objectives and methods\n\nThis project aims to estimate the number of households in Houston that experienced power loss due to the initial two storms. To determine the count of homes affected by power outages, we will spatially join these areas with data on buildings and roads.\n\nThis project also investigates whether socioeconomic factors serve as predictors of community recovery from a power outage. For the exploration of potential socioeconomic factors influencing recovery, the analysis will be linked with data from the US Census Bureau.\n\nThis analysis will rely on remotely-sensed night lights data acquired from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Infrared_Imaging_Radiometer_Suite) aboard the Suomi satellite. Specifically, we will use the VNP46A1 to identify variations in night lights before and after the storms as a method to identify areas that lost electrical power.\n\n## Data\n\n#### Night lights ‚ú®\n\nWe use NASA's Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\n\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\n\n#### Roads üõ£Ô∏è `gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg`\n\nTypically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\n\n[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.¬†\n\n#### Houses üè† `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg`\n\nWe also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n#### Socioeconomic üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb`\n\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS [\"file geodatabase\"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file. We can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt). The geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use.\n\n## Project Roadmap\n\nBelow is an outline of the steps taken to achieve the objectives.\n\n1\\) Find locations of blackouts\n\n2\\) Find homes impacted by blackouts\n\n3\\) Investigate Socioeconomic Factors\n\n4\\) Leverage the results for a summary and discussion\n\n## Importing necessary libraries and functions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Find locations of blackouts\n\nFor improved computational efficiency and easier inter-operability with `sf`, we use the `stars` package for raster handling.\n\n##### [Combining the data]{.underline}\n\nWe first read in night lights tiles, then combine tiles into a single `stars` object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16) using `st_mosaic.`\n\nThe following files had been subsetted & stored in the `VNP46A1` folder.\n\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16\n\n\n\n\n\n##### [Creating a blackout mask]{.underline}\n\nWe then find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm, and reclassify the difference raster, assuming that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ experienced a blackout. Then we assign `NA` to all locations that experienced a drop of *less* than 200 nW cm^-2^sr.^-1^\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm by calculating the light difference between the two dates \ndifference <- combined_02_07 - combined_02_16\n\n\n#check out difference in night lights intensity \nplot(difference)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\ndownsample set to 6\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAssigning all the houses that experienced a drop of 200 and more to a blackout mask.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmask_blackout <- difference > 200 \nmask_blackout[mask_blackout == FALSE]  <- NA\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### [Vectorize the mask]{.underline}\n\nWe use `st_as_sf()` to vectorize the blackout mask and fix any invalid geometries using `st_make_valid.`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nblackout_mask_vector <- st_as_sf(mask_blackout) %>% st_make_valid() ##can plot() to check out what the blackout mask looks like \n```\n:::\n\n\n##### [Cropping the vectorized map to our region of interest]{.underline}\n\n-   We first define the Houston metropolitan area with the following coordinates : (-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29) and then turn these coordinates into a polygon using `st_polygon.`\n-   Then we convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using `st_sfc()` and assign a CRS, making sure that the polygon is in the same CRS and crop (spatially subset) the blackout mask to our region of interest. Lastly we re-project the cropped blackout dataset to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area).\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#crop the vectorized map to our region of interest using polygon of Houston's coordinates \nhouston_polygon <- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-96.5,29), c(-96.5,30.5), c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-94.5,29), c(-96.5,29))))\n\n\n#convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using st_sfc() and assign the CRS 4326, which is the same as the night lights data\nhouston_border_sf <- st_sfc(houston_polygon, crs = st_crs(mask_blackout))\n\n\n#inspect the polygon crs to make sure the crs is 4326, nightlights dataset\n#st_crs(houston_border_sf) == st_crs(mask_blackout)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSpatially subsetting blackout mask to Houston region, then reprojecting to the correct CRS.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### [Excluding highways from blackout mask]{.underline}\n\nThe roads geopackage includes data on roads other than highways. However, we can avoid reading in data we don't need by taking advantage of `st_read`'s ability to subset using a SQL query. First, we load just highway data from geopackage using `st_read and`reproject data to EPSG:3083, identifying areas within 200m of all highways using `st_buffer. st_buffer` produces undissolved buffers, so we use `st_union` to dissolve them. Then we find areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway.\n\n[Read in highway data from roads using SQL query]{.underline} :\n\n`query <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"`\\\n`highways <- st_read(\"data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\", query = query)`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquery <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\nhighways <- st_read(\"~/dev/eds223/assignment-3-floraham/data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg\", query = query)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen reproject and subset using st_difference()\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reproject data to EPSG:3083 \nhighways_3038 <- st_transform(highways, crs=\"EPSG:3083\")\n\n#verify it's the right crs\n#st_crs(highways_3038)\n\n# identify areas within 200m of all highways using st_buffer. Use st_union to dissolve overlapping polygons. \na_near_hwys <- st_buffer(highways_3038, dist = 200) %>% st_union()\n\n# find areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway by spacially subsetting houston blackout areas to ones near highways, and taking st_difference of that. \nblackouts_far_hwy_houston <- final_houston_blackout[a_near_hwys, , op = st_difference] \n\n\n#plot to see what it looks like \n#plot(blackouts_far_hwy_houston)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Finding homes impacted by blackouts\n\n##### [Load buildings data]{.underline}\n\nWe load buildings dataset using `st_read` and the following SQL query to select only residential buildings. We first reproject data to EPSG:3083.\n\nThe SQL query we will use is:\n\n`SELECT *`¬† `FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1`\\\n`WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)`\\\n`OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')`\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#load buildings dataset using st_read and the following SQL query to select only residential buildings\n\nquery_buildings <- \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL) OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\"\n\nbuildings <- st_read(\"~/dev/eds223/assignment-3-floraham/data/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\", query = query_buildings)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### [finding homes in blackout areas]{.underline}\n\nWe filter to homes within blackout areas, then we count number of impacted homes. First, checking for CRS compatibility. Since they aren't, we need to transform and then subset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##check CRS's are the same.
