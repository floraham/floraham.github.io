To determine the count of homes affected by power outages, we will spatially join these areas with \\[OpenStreetMap\\](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) data on buildings and roads.\n\nInvestigate whether socioeconomic factors serve as predictors of community recovery from a power outage. For the exploration of potential socioeconomic factors influencing recovery, the analysis will be linked with data from the US Census Bureau.\n\nThis analysis will rely on remotely-sensed night lights data acquired from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Infrared_Imaging_Radiometer_Suite) aboard the Suomi satellite. Specifically, we will use the VNP46A1 to identify variations in night lights before and after the storms as a method to identify areas that lost electrical power.\n\n## Data\n\n#### Night lights ‚ú®\n\nWe use NASA's Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\n\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\n\nThe following files had been sub-setted & stored in the `VNP46A1` folder.\n\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16\n\n#### Roads üõ£Ô∏è  `gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg`\n\nTypically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\n\n[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.¬†\n\n#### Houses üè† `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg`\n\nWe also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n#### Socioeconomic üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb`\n\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS [\"file geodatabase\"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file. We can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt). The geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use.\n\n## Project Roadmap\n\nBelow is an outline of the steps taken to achieve the objectives.\n\n## Find locations of blackouts\n\nFor improved computational efficiency and easier inter-operability with `sf`, we use the `stars` package for raster handling.\\\n\n##### combine the data\n\n-   We first read in night lights tiles, then combine tiles into a single `stars` object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16) using `st_mosaic.`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Read in all four night lights tiles, in folder VNP46A1, using the package \"stars\" \n\ntile1_2021_02_07 = read_stars(\"~/dev/eds223/assignment-3-floraham/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n \ntile2_2021_02_07 = read_stars(\"~/dev/eds223/assignment-3-floraham/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\ntile3_2021_02_16 =  read_stars(\"~/dev/eds223/assignment-3-floraham/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\ntile4_2021_02_16 =  read_stars(\"~/dev/eds223/assignment-3-floraham/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\", package = \"stars\")\n\n\n# combine tiles into single stars object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16), using st_mosaic \ncombined_02_07 = st_mosaic(tile1_2021_02_07, tile2_2021_02_07)\ncombined_02_16 = st_mosaic(tile3_2021_02_16, tile4_2021_02_16)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### create a blackout mask\n\n-   We then find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm, and reclassify the difference raster, assuming that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ experienced a blackout.
