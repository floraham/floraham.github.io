## I'm Flora 🌿

**I'm an environmental data scientist who is enthusiastic about leveraging data at scale to provide insights for thoughtful environmental management.**

🌎🛰️ Currently, I'm a Research Associate at Colorado State Univeiisty's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), working on projects that leverage ecological data, remote sensing and machine learning to understand vegetative landscapes. At NREL, I'm involved in projects that study the use of virtual fencing for rangeland management. 

❄️️🌳🔥 My latest projects through NASA DEVELOP are titled, "Using Satellite Observations to Assess Relationships between Snowpack and Wildfires in Colorado for Land and Water Utility Management" and "Using Earth Observations to Identify Areas of Oak Decline in Illinois and Investigate Contributing Risk Factors"
