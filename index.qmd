## Hello, I'm Flora!

I'm an environmental data scientist. I use data science to understand and solve environmental problems. 

I'm particularly interested in greenhouse gas management, the carbon economy, and leveraging geospatial technology to solve environmental problems.

Currently, I'm at NASA DEVELOP researching wildfire effects on snowpack in Colorado. Recently, I graduated with a Masters of Environmental Data Science from UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. 

Outside of work, you can find me reading, playing the piano, or on a hike with people I love.
