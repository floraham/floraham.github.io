## I'm Flora 🌿

**I'm an environmental data scientist who is enthusiastic about leveraging data at scale to provide insights for thoughtful environmental management.**

🌎🛰️ Currently, I'm at NASA DEVELOP and the Natural Resource and Ecology Laboratory (NREL) at Colorado State University, working on projects that leverage remote sensing and machine learning to understand vegetative landscapes. At DEVELOP, I'm investigating oak tree decline in Illinois, and at NREL, I'm involved in projects that study the use of virtual fencing for rangeland management. 

❄️🔥 My latest project through NASA DEVELOP is titled, "Using Satellite Observations to Assess Relationships between Snowpack and Wildfires in Colorado for Land and Water Utility Management."
