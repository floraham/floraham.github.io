## Hello, I'm Flora

I'm a current masters student at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, pursuing a degree in Environmental Data Science. I draw from a breadth of disciplines to understand and solve problems pertaining to the carbon economy and GHG's. When not thinking about data science I'm reading, playing board games, or recharging in the outdoors.
