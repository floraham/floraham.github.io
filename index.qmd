## I'm Flora üåø

**I transform geospatial and ecological data into actionable insights for environmental decision-making.**

üêÑ Currently, I'm a Research Associate at Colorado State University's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), supporting rangeland management projects. My current work integrates datasets from field samples, remote sensing technology, and other sources to analyze landscape patterns and support evidence-based management strategies.

üõ∞Ô∏è Previous to my current position, I authored in two NASA DEVELOP papers in 2024: ["Using Satellite Observations to Assess Relationships between Snowpack and Wildfires in Colorado for Land and Water Utility Management"](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240009568) and "[Using Earth Observations to Identify Areas of Oak Decline in Illinois and Investigate Contributing Risk Factors](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250004216/downloads/2024Fall_GSFC_IllinoisEco_TechPaper_FD-final.pdf)." I also earned a Master of Environmental Data Science in 2024, culminating my degree in launching a reproducible carbon emissions accounting tool for Darn Tough, Vermont.

üíª Technical Skills: R, Python, Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, Remote Sensing Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Excel, Data Management, Modelling, Git
