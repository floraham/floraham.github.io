## Hello, I'm Flora!

I'm an environmental data analyst. 

I recently graduated with a masters of Environmental Data Science from UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I take a multidisciplinary approach to understand and solve problems pertaining to environmental issues, and I'm particularly interested in greenhouse gas management, the carbon economy, and leveraging geospatial technology to solve environmental problems. When not thinking about these seemingly impossible challenges, I'm reading, playing board games, or recharging in the outdoors.
