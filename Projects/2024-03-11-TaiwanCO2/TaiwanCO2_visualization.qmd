In this blog post, I'll be diving into the current carbon emissions trends of Taiwan, and visualizing these trends with three plot types. Taiwan is an island located in the western Pacific Ocean, about 100 miles off the coast of southeastern China. It's approximately 245 miles long and 90 miles wide and is home to about 24 million people who speak languages like Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, and indigenous languages.

```{r echo=FALSE, warnings = FALSE, messages = FALSE }
#load leaflet library
library(leaflet)

# Create a leaflet map centered on Taiwan with OpenStreetMap as a basemap
taiwan_map <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = 120.9605, lat = 23.6978, zoom = 7) %>%
  addTiles()  # OpenStreetMap as a basemap

# Adding a marker for Taipei 
taiwan_map <- taiwan_map %>% addMarkers(lng = 121.5654, lat = 25.0328, popup = "Taipei")

# Display the map

```

# Why Taiwan?

I've chosen to analyze Taiwan's carbon emissions because it is a country that has enormous potential to decarbonize. Taiwan's biggest power station is also the world's #1 top emitter of GHG emissions. According to [Statista,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1393557/most-polluting-power-plants-worldwide/#:~:text=The%20Taichung%20Power%20Plant%20in,power%20station%20in%20the%20world.) "**The Taichung Power Plant in Taiwan was the most polluting power station worldwide in 2022**, having released an estimated 32.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCOâ‚‚e). With an installed capacity of 5,500 megawatts, the coal-fired **Taichung Power Plant is the fourth largest power station in the world**." Just decarbonizing this one power plant alone can result in a dramatic reduction in Taiwan's overall emissions.

Transitioning to renewable energy is crucial for Taiwan. By moving towards renewable energy sources, Taiwan can enhance its energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. Embracing renewables also helps in combating climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global sustainability efforts. Economically, investing in clean energy offers growth opportunities and innovation potential, with Taiwan's private sector already [showing commitment](https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/08/on-the-path-to-net-zero-will-taiwan-reach-its-goal/) to a cleaner energy future. This shift not only positions Taiwan as a regional leader in sustainable energy but also contributes to an environmentally resilient future for the island. We will be getting a better of idea of where Taiwan currently stands in its emissions generation through visualizing data from [ClimateTrace](https://climatetrace.org/) and [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

# Data, Approach, Limitations

## The Data

-   **Sector specific emissions:** This year [ClimateTrace](https://climatetrace.org/) introduced an open emissions database with over 352 million assets, covering human-caused emissions from various facilities globally. It spans every country, major economic sector, and nearly all greenhouse gas emission sources. This detailed dataset, accessible for free, is one of the most comprehensive and granular view of recent GHG emissions available for the public. Utilizing satellites, remote sensing, AI, and machine learning, it offers transparency for assessing each country's emission reduction progress. This project subsets the dataset for Taiwan's emissions from 2016-2022.

    Access the dataset [here](https://climatetrace.org/inventory%20year_from=2022&year_to=2022&gas=co2e100).

-   **Historical CO2 per capita emissions & CO2 contributions by fuel type:**

    OurWorldInData compiles data on many countries' emissions data from work from many different people and organizations. We will be using their datasets historical CO2 per capita emissions & CO2 contributions by fuel type in 2020, subsetting for just Taiwan's data.

    Access the datasets [here](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

## The Approach

\
I chose to communicate the data through an infographic, incorporating a line plot, pie chart, and stacked area chart arranged to evoke an industrial ambiance. The line chart mimics the emission of smoke from a stack, the pie chart suggests a moon, and the stacked area chart resembles a container on a ship. The overall dark, nocturnal theme not only adds a sense of foreboding but also implies a lack of transparency, creating an ominous atmosphere for the observer. A keen-eyed viewer might notice an additional smoke plume subtly resembling the shape of Taiwan.

For enhanced visibility, I opted for high-contrast colors of dark grey and white, and bolded the text in Josefin and Times New Roman for the title. Alt text was included to improve web usability. To prevent information overload, I balanced the data-ink ratio, removing grid lines and simplifying the message, especially in the stacked area plot, where font size indicates relative proportions.

The predominantly monochrome palette ensures color-blind friendliness, and I used online colorblind simulators to confirm the graphic's accessibility. To address the topic on level of individual agency, I incorporated a graphic detailing Taiwan's per capita emissions. Additionally, I provided a concise blurb to contextualize the significance of the topic, ensuring that viewers grasp its importance.

## Limitations

This visualization falls short of directly engaging with the critical aspects surrounding the feasibility of decarbonization in Taiwan. It does not delve into the economic, socioeconomic, and environmental repercussions associated with such a transition. Furthermore, it does not offer actionable suggestions. Instead, the visualization primarily serves as an overview of Taiwan's current carbon emissions landscape.

  ))

# Filter out rows based on multiple values
values_to_exclude <- c( "biological-treatment-of-solid-waste-and-biogenic", "other-transport", "removals")
emissions_df <- emissions_df %>% drop_na() %>% filter(!(sector %in% values_to_exclude))


### Now, aggregate emissions for each subsector 
emissions_df_subsector <- emissions_df %>% group_by(subsector, year) %>% mutate(co2e_100yr_subsector = sum(co2e_100yr)) %>% select(-c("co2e_100yr", "sector"))

```

The next step is to ignore negative emissions, or CO2e sinks, so that we can analyze just total emissions output (as opposed to net emissions). Taiwan's negative emissions are quite small, so it would simplify this analysis a bit to remove it.

```{r}
###for emissions by gas type... removing sinks / removals in order to show totals not net. 
emissions_gas <- emissions %>% select(year, co2, ch4, n2o) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(
    co2 = sum(co2, na.rm = TRUE),
    ch4 = sum(ch4, na.rm = TRUE),
    n2o = sum(n2o, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% pivot_longer(cols = co2:n2o,
                     names_to = "gas",
                     values_to = "annual_emissions")

emissions_sorted <- emissions_df %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  arrange(year)
```

This stacked area plot investigates emissions by sector, showing each sector's relative proportion of co2 emissions in billions of megatons from 2015 to 2022, as well as the total emissions in billions of megatons. The choice of a stacked area plot was motivated by the consistent stability of overall emissions across the years within each sector; notably, the power sector occupies the greatest proportion, followed by manufacturing, transportation, and fossil fuel operations. To enhance the clarity, I arranged the proportions by size, grouping those smaller than fossil fuel operations into the "other" category, colored in a grey scale. To simplify the message and reduce information overload, I opted to emphasize relative contribution through Font size, rather than percentage. Although the font size is not tied to any strict proportion, it effectively communicates that power holds the largest share of contributions.

This pie plot extends upon the stacked area plot, to ask the further question, within the power sector, what fuel source is the largest emitter of green house gas? This pie plot clearly shows the contributions of coal, oil, and gas, along with an "others" category to overall power emissions. Coal claims the largest segment, comprising approximately 56% of the total, while oil and gas evenly divide the remaining portion, each contributing around 22%. Once again, to maintain clarity and avoid information overlaoad, I've chosen to streamline the information by emphasizing the percentage contributions rather than presenting the absolute quantity.

I use a line plot to address the question: "How does Taiwan's per capita emissions stack up against those of other nations globally?" The visual representation juxtaposes Taiwan's per capita emissions with those of the United States and China, alongside averages for country groups based on income. Taiwan is highlighted with a gold color, while the United States and China are in white. The income group averages are grey. This dataset spans from the onset of the industrial revolution (early 1800's), and it shows a surge in Taiwan's emissions post-1960, coinciding with Taiwan's robust economic expansion during that period.

In the 1960s, Taiwan experienced the "Taiwan Miracle," marked by rapid economic growth and industrialization. Key factors included land reforms, export-oriented policies, foreign investments, and educational advancements. This period shifted Taiwan's economy from that based on agriculture to export-focused industries, resulting in significant economic expansion and a surge in per capita emissions post-1960.

Notably, we see that Taiwan's emissions are now higher than that of most high-income countries, including China, and are converging close to that of the United States!

quotes <- c("Taiwan's current carbon emissions standing is significant, with the country being among the top 25 largest carbon emitters globally. In recent years, Taiwan has been taking steps towards reducing its carbon footprint and transitioning to cleaner energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The country has set ambitious goals, such as investing in renewable energy technologies and implementing a carbon fee system for large emitters to incentivize emission reduction. In order to understand how these plans can change Taiwanâ€™s carbon footprint in the long-term, we need to first understand the countryâ€™s current baseline in terms of carbon emissions.

            "The country's CO2 emissions per capita have also varied, with Taiwan emitting around 11 to 12 tons of CO2 per person annually. Taiwanâ€™s total CO2 emissions current fluctuate around 300 million tons a year, almost half of which is from power generation. Coal is the dirtiest power source, contributing over 55% of the CO2 emissions from the power sector.

This is pretty close to being finished! I wanted to add a cityscapes background, a ship, and some smoke stacks, along with a png file of a plume in the shape of Taiwan. I continued the work in Google Slides to create the desired effects (cutting and pasting a bit, to nudge objects to where they needed to be) and the final result is below.
