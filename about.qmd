## {{< fa code >}} Currently...

Curently, I'm an Ecological Research Associate at Colorado State University's (CSU) Natural Resource and Ecology Laboratory (NREL), contributing to rangeland management projects and more. I use data science methods, geoprogramming, and machine learning to synthesize both remotely sensed and field sampled datasets, evaluating field conditions and management project impacts.

I am passionate about technical research, bridging data science to stakeholders, and exploring the vast world of quantitative ecology.

I grew up in Taiwan and Oregon, two vastly different regions each with their unique ecosystems. Taiwan's mountains host a range of forest types, from subtropical forests in the lowlands to temperate and alpine forests at higher elevations. On the other hand, Oregon's high deserts, alpine forests, and basalt rock groups together create a whole other universe for exploration. My early acquaintances with these two polar opposite natural worlds ‚Äî mangrove forests, banyan trees, and Formosan Rock Macaques monkeys in Taiwan‚Äî and redwoods, salmon berries, and Columbia Sturgeon in Oregon, fostered a life-long appreciation for productive ecosystems and the natural world.

My interest in quantitative environmental research began at Bowdoin College, where I earned a B.A. from Bowdoin College (in Maine) in 2021 with degrees in mathematics and environmental studies, plus an economics minor. My career path first took me back to Taipei, where I worked with tech start-ups through SOSV, a multinational venture capital, developing an interest in applying technology to problem solve at scale. My data analyst internship with Cary Institute of Ecosystem studies propelled me to pursue data science as a career, and in 2024, I completed my master's in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School in Santa Barbara, culminating in the development of a reproducible emissions model for Darn Tough, Vermont.

After graduation, I joined NASA's DEVELOP program to support the understanding and management of critical environmental systems, like alpine forests in the Rocky Mountains and oak stands in the Midwest (check them out ‚ùÑÔ∏è[here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240009568) and ü™æ[here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250004216/downloads/2024Fall_GSFC_IllinoisEco_TechPaper_FD-final.pdf)) and met the team at NREL.

Outside of work, you can most likely find me reading science fiction, tangled up in music theory, or on a hike!
