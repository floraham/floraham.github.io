## {{< fa code >}} Currently...

Curently, I'm an environmental data analyst at CSU's Natural Resource and Ecology Laboratory, contributing to rangeland management projects that leverage virtual fencing technology. I leverage data science and statistical modeling to analyze integrated remotely sensed and field sampled datasets, evaluating the ecological impacts of virtual fencing initiatives across Colorado landscapes. Previous to NREL, I completed two NASA DEVELOP projects following the completion of my masters in environmental data science at the Bren School.

I grew up in Taiwan, where on weekends, my family would take adventures through the island's deep mountains. Taiwan's mountains host a range of forest types, from subtropical forests in the lowlands to temperate and alpine forests at higher elevations. My early acquaintance with beetles, cicada, shy grass ([Mimosa pudica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosa_pudica)), and Formosan Rock Macaques monkeys fostered a life-long appreciation for productive ecosystems and the natural world.

I graduated from Bowdoin College in 2021 with degrees in mathematics and environmental studies, plus an economics minor. My career path then took me back to Taipei, where I worked with tech startups through SOSV, a venture capital, developing an interest in using technology to problem solve at scale. In 2024, I completed my master's in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School, culminating in the development of an emissions model for Darn Tough, Vermont.\

Building on this foundation, I joined NASA's DEVELOP program, where I applied machine-learning, remote-sensing methods, and my geoprogramming skillset to advance scientific knowledge and extract value from data. This work directly supported the management of critical environmental systems.

Outside of work, you can most likely find me reading science fiction and history, playing the piano, or volunteering.
