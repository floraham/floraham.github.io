Flora Hamilton graduated from Bowdoin College in 2021 with bachelor's degrees in mathematics and environmental studies, and a minor in economics. With a liberal arts philosophy in mind, Flora took her quantitative foundations to Taipei where she gained exposure to the workings of mobile technology startups in Southeast Asia and early-stage investing at SOSV, a multinational venture capital firm. This time abroad kindled her interest in applying science and technology to solving environmental issues at scale.\
\
In 2022 Flora returned to Oregon, where she applied her knowledge of geospatial and remote-sensing methods to support pollinator habitat restoration in agricultural landscapes of the Willamette Valley. Most recently, she worked with ecologists at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a nonprofit environmental science research center in Millbrook, NY, to source long-term environmental datasets for its state-funded science education program.\
\
With exposure to a variety of organizational structures, Flora is excited to take her knowledge of environmental data science forward. Through the Climate and Energy specialization at the Bren School, she wants to apply machine-learning, remote-sensing methods, and econometrics to advance scientific knowledge and extract value from data to support and manage carbon dependent systems.
