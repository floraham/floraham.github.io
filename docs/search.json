    "text": "Flora Hamilton graduated from Bowdoin College in 2021 with bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and environmental studies, and a minor in economics. With a liberal arts philosophy in mind, Flora took her quantitative foundations to Taipei where she gained exposure to the workings of mobile technology startups in Southeast Asia and early-stage investing at SOSV, a multinational venture capital firm. This time abroad kindled her interest in applying science and technology to solving environmental issues at scale.\n\nIn 2022 Flora returned to Oregon, where she applied her knowledge of geospatial and remote-sensing methods to support pollinator habitat restoration in agricultural landscapes of the Willamette Valley. Most recently, she worked with ecologists at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a nonprofit environmental science research center in Millbrook, NY, to source long-term environmental datasets for its state-funded science education program.\n\nWith exposure to a variety of organizational structures, Flora is excited to take her knowledge of environmental data science forward. Through the Climate and Energy specialization at the Bren School, she wants to apply machine-learning, remote-sensing methods, and econometrics to advance scientific knowledge and extract value from data to support and manage carbon dependent systems."

    "text": "Welcome to my first blog post\nIf you’re reading this, thanks for stopping by! I am currently learning data science through the Masters of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara.\nThis blog space will be used as a space to showcase & keep track of my data science projects, and practice my data communication skills. I also hope to make these blog posts informative, accessible, and friendly.\nIn my senior spring at Bowdoin College I did what every liberal arts STEM student must do for a last hurrah. In my case, I took a course cross registered under the English, Italian, and Religion departments: Dante’s Divine Comedy. The next-to-final assignment in the course was to do a formal, close-reading of any Canto (Chapter) of our choice. When I got my paper comments back, the professor remarked in red pen (in an endearing tone) that I should start…. a blog :,)\nI guess that now, years later, is my time to shine.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{hamilton2023,\n  author = {Hamilton, Flora},\n  title = {My First Blog Post},\n  date = {2023-11-06},\n  url = {https://floraham.github.io/Projects/2023-11-06-my-first-post},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHamilton, Flora. 2023. “My First Blog Post.” November 6,\n2023. https://floraham.github.io/Projects/2023-11-06-my-first-post."
